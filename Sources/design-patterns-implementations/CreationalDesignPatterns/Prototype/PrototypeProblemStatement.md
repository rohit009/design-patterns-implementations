## Problem statement: 

Consider a problem where you need to design a prototype-based cloning system for a paint software
or web app where user will be able to paint or draw different shapes. User can also duplicate a
specific shape already drawn or can select an existing shape from menu like square, rectangle and
circle.

Your task is to implement a prototype-based cloning system using the Prototype design pattern to
create new shapes based on existing ones efficiently. The duplicate shape should be shown 10
points to the left.
