## Problem: Computer configuration system

You need to design a system for creating customized computer configurations. Each computer can
have various components, such as CPU, RAM, storage, graphics card, and peripherals like monitor, 
keyboard, and mouse. The challenge is to create a flexible mechanism to construct different types
of computer configurations with varying components while ensuring that the configuration process
remains modular and easy to manage.

Your task is to design the computer configuration system using the Builder design pattern to
separate the configuration process from the representation of the final computer objects.

#### Assumptions:
- Task is to build computer configuration and not actual computer object.
