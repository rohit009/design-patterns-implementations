Problem:

Let's consider a scenario where you need to design a GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for an
iOS app development framework. The library should support multiple themes, such as "Light Mode" and
"Dark Mode," and each theme should have its own set of UI elements, including buttons, text fields,
and labels.

Your task is to design the GUI library to create families of UI elements that belong to different
themes while ensuring that the client code (the app developers) can switch between themes seamlessly.

Assumptions:
- The Actual UI elements will be not changed and only their color will change on theme change.
