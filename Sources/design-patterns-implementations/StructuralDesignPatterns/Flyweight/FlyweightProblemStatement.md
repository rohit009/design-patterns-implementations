## Problem statement

Consider a problem related to a text formatting and rendering system. You are tasked with
implementing a system that can render documents with various text styles, fonts, and colors.
However, you want to optimize memory usage by reusing font and color objects where possible.

Your task is to share and reuse font and color objects across different text segments in the
document while allowing each segment to have its own unique content.
