## Problem statement: 

Consider a scenario where you are working on a music player application, and you have a class that
plays music in a specific format, let's say the MP3Player class. However, you now want to add
support for playing music in a different format, such as FLAC. The FLACPlayer class has a different
interface that is incompatible with the existing MP3Player.

Your task is to implement the design pattern to adapt the FLACPlayer to the existing music player
application so that it can seamlessly play music in both MP3 and FLAC formats.
